Hello Coder !!!

I am adding this repository as public today on 07-12-2024

This repository contains example usage of SOME basic attributes of matplotlib library
this may help you in understanding the use cases of matplotlib

on actual matplotlib website (https://matplotlib.org/) you can find the real projects of this library
but this repository is more focused on my practice and on the level of things I learned in programming journey

Thanks for accessing this link
I wish you create something beneficial for the world

have a Good Life :)
